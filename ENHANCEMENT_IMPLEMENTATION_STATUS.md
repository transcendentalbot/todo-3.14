# MVP Enhancement Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of push notifications, client-side encryption, and SMS backup features for the Wellness Companion app.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Documentation Updates
- Updated PRD-Phase1-MVP.md with enhancement requirements
- Updated PRD-Reminders-Alerts.md with technical implementation details
- Added implementation timeline (Weeks 11-16)

### 2. Push Notifications Infrastructure
- Generated VAPID keys for web push
- Created backend endpoints:
  - `/notifications/subscribe` - Store push subscriptions
  - `/notifications/send` - Send push notifications
- Implemented notification handler with SMS fallback
- Created custom service worker with push event handling
- Added notification quick actions (complete/snooze)

### 3. Client-Side Encryption
- Implemented EncryptionService class using crypto-js
- Password-derived key generation with PBKDF2
- Automatic encryption/decryption in API interceptors
- Updated all tracking endpoints to support encrypted data
- Backward compatibility for unencrypted data

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Created NotificationPrompt component
- Integrated push notification service
- Added notification permission flow after login
- Updated Dashboard to show notification prompt

### 5. Backend Updates
- Added VAPID keys to environment configuration
- Updated serverless.yml with new endpoints
- Added SNS permissions for SMS backup
- Created scheduled notification trigger Lambda
- Set up EventBridge rules for 4 daily notifications

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend (.env)
```
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BP83nSNqLs_KnH2iFtIvJqAIMVMQtFFlTevsgz5o1nzZHhfozU9YGXwNkpSGnIB6e_4FEnXTX9x8jxS5YcI4lqA
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=1-Rbe8xi9Ufmoq0CxIhJpLrl5DJustXlfbO8_2FwJW8
VAPID_EMAIL=mailto:admin@wellness-companion.com
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backend Deployment**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   serverless deploy
   ```

2. **Frontend Deployment**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Deploy dist folder to hosting
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test encryption/decryption for all tracking endpoints
- [ ] Verify push notifications on iOS Safari PWA
- [ ] Verify push notifications on Android Chrome PWA
- [ ] Test SMS fallback for high-priority notifications
- [ ] Verify EventBridge triggers at scheduled times
- [ ] Test notification quick actions
- [ ] Verify offline queue handling
- [ ] Check performance impact of encryption

## Security Considerations

1. **Encryption**: All user data is encrypted on the client before transmission
2. **Key Management**: Encryption keys are derived from user passwords
3. **No Recovery**: Lost passwords mean lost data (by design)
4. **HTTPS Required**: Service workers and push notifications require HTTPS

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Test with real devices (iOS and Android)
3. Monitor CloudWatch logs for scheduled notifications
4. Set up cost alerts for SMS usage
5. Implement notification preferences UI
6. Add notification history tracking

## Known Limitations

1. iOS PWA requires app to be added to home screen for notifications
2. No password recovery means permanent data loss if forgotten
3. SMS backup only for critical alerts to control costs
4. EventBridge times are in UTC (adjust for user timezones in Phase 2)
